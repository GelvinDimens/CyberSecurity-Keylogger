## Features

- Captures keystrokes in real-time.
- Logs keystrokes to a local file.
- Sends logs via email.
- Built with Python for easy customization.
- Lightweight and efficient.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **pynput**: A library to monitor and control input devices.
- **smtplib**: For sending emails with the captured logs.
- **JSON**: For storing configuration settings.

## Installation

To get started with the CyberSecurity Keylogger, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GelvinDimens/CyberSecurity-Keylogger.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd CyberSecurity-Keylogger
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

4. **Download the latest release**:

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/GelvinDimens/CyberSecurity-Keylogger/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to execute the downloaded file.

## Usage

To run the keylogger, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes and will log them to a specified file. Ensure that you have configured your email settings in the script to receive the logs.

## How It Works

The CyberSecurity Keylogger operates by monitoring keyboard input through the `pynput` library. Here's a brief overview of its workflow:

1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the keylogger and sets up the email configuration.
2. **Key Capture**: It listens for keystrokes using the `pynput` library.
3. **Logging**: Each keystroke is logged to a file for later analysis.
4. **Email Sending**: Periodically, the log file is sent to a predefined email address.

This method allows for real-time monitoring and logging of keyboard input, making it a useful tool for ethical hacking and cybersecurity research.
